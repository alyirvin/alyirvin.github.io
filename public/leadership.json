            "description": "As president, I orchestrated numerous successful recruitment events, leading to record high increases in membership. Through collaborative efforts with Honors College faculty and volunteers, I was able to create college wide events to attract members and build connections with new students. Additionally, I led a merchandise drive, generating significant revenue through dues and merchandise sales. In the fall semester, I prioritized creating a dedicated space for freshmen within the honors community, fostering networking opportunities and mentorship. Steering a team of 15 officers and 40 committee members, I provided strategic guidance to ensure the attainment of collective goals and objectives.",
