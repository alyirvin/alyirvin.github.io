      "description": "Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Alysha, a senior dual-degree student studying Mechanical Engineering and Biomedical sciences, with a minor in Computer Science. I'm excited to announce my upcoming pursuit of a Master's of Science in Computer Science starting this fall! Take a moment to explore my page and discover what I've been working on. Alongside my personal work, you'll find some of the recent projects I've collaborated on with my team, Girls Who Can't Code. We're a group of unconventional programmers dedicated to honing our skills and embracing an interdisciplinary approach to programming. Thanks for stopping by ðŸ’œ",
